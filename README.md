Rent_Up is a rental management project developed to manage rental-related operations in a structured and organized manner. The project is intended for academic learning and practical implementation of software development concepts.

The application allows basic handling of rental data and follows a modular structure, making it easy to understand, run, and extend.

Project setup requires Python to be installed on the system.

To run the project, first open Command Prompt or PowerShell and move to the project directory:

`cd D:\code\Rent_Up`

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

`python -m venv env`
`env\Scripts\activate`

Install required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the project using:

`python app.py`

(If the main file has a different name, replace `app.py` accordingly.)

The project folder structure is organized as follows:

* Main application file (app.py or similar)
* requirements.txt for dependencies
* README.md for documentation
* Additional folders such as templates, static files, or modules if applicable

To push the project to GitHub:

`git init`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "Initial commit"`
`git branch -M main`
`git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/Rent_Up.git`
`git push -u origin main`

Future improvements may include database integration, authentication, UI enhancement, and deployment support.

If you want this rewritten **more professionally**, **very short**, or **tailored for placements**, tell me the preference and I’ll adjust it.
